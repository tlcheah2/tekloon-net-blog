I think a lot, code often, and write sporadically, prioritizing thoughtful consideration and coding over extensive writing

So with this blog, I hope I can document more and build my second brain.

"Passionate thinker, avid coder, and occasional wordsmithâ€”I'm Tek Loon. With a mind that constantly churns with ideas, I dedicate ample time to thoughtful contemplation and coding endeavors. While my writing may be sporadic, each word is carefully chosen to convey the essence of my insights. Join me on a journey where contemplation meets code, and the written word serves as a deliberate reflection of my ever-evolving perspectives.". By ChatGPT 3.5
