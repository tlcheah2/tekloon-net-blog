## Intro

Hey there! So, I've been diving into books and thought of a cool way to share what I find in each chapter. 

I split up my reviews into three neat parts: [Key Insights Unveiled](#key-insights-unveiled), [Snippet that Sparkle](#snippet-that-sparkle), and [Synopsis in My Own Sentence](#synopsis-in-my-own-sentence). 

It's like a fun journey through the chapters, picking out the best stuff and wrapping it up in a nutshell. 

Let's explore these chapters together, uncovering the highlights, favorite moments, and a bite-sized summary for each!

## Key Insights Unveiled
1. We always have false assumptions on everything need hard work and hard-earned.
2. Not all things have to be hard. Ask youself, could this be easy?

## Snippet that Sparkle

> It's curious to me how we default to sayings like "It won't be easy, but it's worth it" or "It's going to be really hard to make that happen, but we should try."
It's like we all automatically accept that the "right" way is, inevitably, the harder one.

It amazed me that how true this snippet is.

A very good example is we value a hard day's work more than a normal day. We never really value a slower day or a day of doing nothing.

We never really value the rest day or the day of doing nothing.

## Synopsis in My Own Sentence

Bro, are there a easier way to achieve 'X'?
