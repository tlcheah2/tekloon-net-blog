## Intro

Hey there! So, I've been diving into books and thought of a cool way to share what I find in each chapter. 

I split up my reviews into three neat parts: [Key Insights Unveiled](#key-insights-unveiled), [Snippet that Sparkle](#snippet-that-sparkle), and [Synopsis in My Own Sentence](#synopsis-in-my-own-sentence). 

It's like a fun journey through the chapters, picking out the best stuff and wrapping it up in a nutshell. 

Let's explore these chapters together, uncovering the highlights, favorite moments, and a bite-sized summary for each!

## Key Insights Unveiled
1. Things shouldn't be hard which is pretty counterintuitive. People always say nice thing take tremendous effort and should be hard. But there might be a relatively easier approach.

2. Make essential activities become easier.


## Snippet that Sparkle

> When the essentials become too hard to handle, you can either give up on them or you can find an easier way. 

> Essentialism is about doing the right thing; Effortless is about doing them in the right way.

This snippet resonate with me so much. How many times we overcomplicate the situation, and make thing harder than it was and end up exhaust ourselves.

A good example would be in investing, where we try to time the market, and try to find the best stock and best time to invest in. 

When in reality, we should just invest in index fund and let the market do its thing.

Isn't that a effortless way.

## Synopsis in My Own Sentence

Bro, you try too hard. There must be an easier way.
