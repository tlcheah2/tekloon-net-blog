Bulk Purchase allow you to save time and probably saving money as well. 

Saving money is great, but it's not the thing that matters in this discussion.

If you could bulk purchase something that you use regularly, you could reduce the number of times you need to go to the store.

Recently, I tried implement bulk purchase on my own life.

- Bought 2 months portion of my dog's allergy medicine. (I used to buy it bi-weekly)
- My kid's fruit juice. (I used to buy it monthly, now I buy it quarterly)
- My kid's diapers. (I used to buy it monthly, now I buy it quarterly)

## Requirements

Here are some of the requirements to make this work.

- You need to have more money as you buy in bulk
- You need to have space to store the bulk purchase
- Your consumption cannot increase when you buy in bulk, otherwise it will defeat the purpose
