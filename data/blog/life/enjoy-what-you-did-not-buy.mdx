We always want nice thing in our life, a bigger house, a more luxurious car or a luxurious products.

However literally everyone living person in the earth unable to afford every single thing they want in their life.

So how could you still feel content & calm when you saw the nice thing you want but you can't afford?

## I did not spend on X, so I get to spend on Y

I like pretty & luxurious car. But I rarely drive, that didn't feel right to buy a car but you don't drive.

A single way that helped me feel content and calm after seeing other nice car is:

> Because I did not spend on X, so I get to spend on Y

The above statement is so helpful to make me feel rich and content. For e.g,

- Because I did not spend on BMW, so I get to spend on living a better house.
- Because I did not spend on BMW, so I get to spend on buying groceries at a better place.

Using above statement help me justify what I get to enjoy because I did not spend that on some other stuff immediately bring me contentment and remind my purpose/goal.

Let's stay content and calm.
