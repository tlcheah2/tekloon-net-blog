> What we consider to be harmless indulgence can easily become a full-blown addictions. - [The Daily Stoic]

I have been thinking about this quote for a while now. 

Some indulgence that I couldn't downgrade:

- Since I upgrade my stay to 5 star hotel once, I can't go back to 3 star hotel.
- Drink coffee every morning and never thought about starting a day without it.
- Online Shopping

I am not sure if I can call it an addiction, but I am sure that I can't downgrade it or I am not willing to downgrade it if I have a choice.

So what's your addiction?
